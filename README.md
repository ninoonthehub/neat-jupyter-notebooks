# neat-jupyter-notebooks
This repository contains two notebooks exploring the NEAT tool from the NEST ecosystem. The notebooks contain an analysis on reduced (or few-compartmental) models of the granule and Purkinje cerebellar cells, respectively. They are a part of my thesis for my bachelor degree in Artificial Intelligence under the University of Pavia, Milano Statale and Milano Bicocca.
An .swc file for the morphology of the granule, a modified version of the granule cell morphology produced in the laboratory of Brain and Behavioral Sciences of the University of Pavia, loaded in its respective notebook, is also provided.
