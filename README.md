# neat-jupyter-notebooks
This repository contains two notebooks exploring the NEAT tool from the NEST ecosystem. The notebooks contain an analysis on reduced (or few-compartmental) models of the granule and Purkinje cerebellar cells, respectively. They are a part of my thesis for my bachelor degree in Artificial Intelligence under the University of Pavia, Milano Statale and Milano Bicocca.
An .swc file for the morphology of the granule, a modified version of the granule cell morphology produced in the laboratory of Brain and Behavioral Sciences of the University of Pavia, loaded in its respective notebook, is also provided.
Finall, one can also find the .pdf of my thesis itself, and especially in Chapter 4 one can find instructions on how to set up the environment to get the .ipynb files running and a comment on the results of the notebooks.
