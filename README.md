# neat-jupyter-notebooks
This repository contains two notebooks exploring the NEAT tool from the NEST ecosystem. They are related to reduced or few-compartmental models of the Granule and Purkinje cerebellar cells. They are part of the thesis for my bachelor degree in Artificial Intelligence under the University of Pavia, Milano Statale and Milano Bicocca.
